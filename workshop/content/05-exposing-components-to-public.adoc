We have updated `frontend` to connect to our `backend`, allowing our application's components to communicate. Let's now create an external URL for our application so we can see it in action:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
odo url create frontend --port 8080
----

Once the URL has been created in the `frontend` component's configuration, you will see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
✓  URL created for component: frontend
To create URL on the OpenShift cluster, please run `odo push`
----

The change can now be pushed:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
odo push
----

`odo` will print the URL generated for the application. It should be located in the middle of the output from `odo push` similar to the output below:

[source,bash]
----
