## Goal

Learn how to use the *OpenShift Do* (`odo`) command line tool to build and deploy applications on OpenShift.

## Concepts

* `odo` developer tool abstracts deployment tasks
* OpenShift Projects and Applications
* OpenShift Web Console’s Developer Perspective
* Multi-tiered applications with a web frontend
* Automatic OpenShift Builds for iterative development

## Use case

Odo is a developer-centric tool for building and running software on OpenShift. Odo streamlines common build and deployment tasks to let you focus on your application’s source code. You can use odo to reduce the cognitive load and rote steps that are typically involved when working on complex applications built using a mixed stack of component solutions.

## The Environment

During this lab, you will be using a hosted OpenShift environment that is created just for you. This environment is not shared with other users of the system. Because each user completing this lab has their own environment, we had to make some concessions to ensure the overall platform is stable and used only for this training. For that reason, your environment will only be active for 2.5 hours. Keep this in mind before you get started on the content. In addition, your session will time out after 15 minutes of inactivity. Each time you start this training, a new environment will be created on the fly.

This deployment is a self-contained environment that provides everything you need to be successful learning the platform. This includes a command line environment, the OpenShift web console, public URLs, and sample applications.
