We've deployed the first version of our application and tested it by visiting it with a browser. Let's look at how OpenShift and `odo` help make it easier to iterate on that app once it's running.

First, make sure you are still in the `frontend` directory:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
cd ~/frontend
----

Now, we will tell `odo` to `watch` for changes on the file system in the background. Note that the `&` is included to run `odo watch` in the background for this tutorial, but it is usually just run as `odo watch` and can be terminated using `ctrl+c`.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
odo watch &
----

Let's change the displayed name for our wild west game. Currently, the title is "Wild West The OpenShift Way!" We will change this to "My App The OpenShift Way!"

Edit the file `index.html` with a search-and-replace one-liner performed with the Unix stream editor, `sed`:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
sed -i "s/Wild West/My App/" index.html
----

There may be a slight delay before `odo` recognizes the change. Once the change is recognized, `odo` will push the changes to the `frontend` component and print its status to the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
File /root/frontend/index.html changed
File  changed
Pushing files...
✓  Waiting for component to start [10ms]
✓  Syncing files to the component [16s]
✓  Building component [6s]

Refresh the application's page in the web browser. You will see the new name in the web interface for the application.

*NOTE*: If you no longer have the application page opened in a browser, you can recall the url by executing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
odo url list
