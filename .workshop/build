# This 'build' script is where you can add steps that should be run when
# building the image for your custom workshop.

# Move the workshop content to '/opt/app-root/workshop'. It could be left
# at it's default location of '/opt/app-root/src/workshop', but by moving it,
# it is out of view of the user doing the workshop and they aren't likely to
# delete it by accident and break the display of the workshop content.
